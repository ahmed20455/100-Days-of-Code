Problem Statement: Escape the Maze with Reeborg

In Reeborg's World, you are faced with the challenge of guiding Reeborg, the friendly robot, through a maze to reach the exit. The maze is represented as a grid-based environment with walls and obstacles that Reeborg must navigate around. Your task is to write a Python program that directs Reeborg to find its way through the maze and safely reach the exit.

Objective:

Write a Python program to guide Reeborg through the maze to reach the exit.
Reeborg should navigate around obstacles, avoid traps, and follow a path to the exit point.
The program should be efficient, using minimal steps to reach the exit.
Constraints:

Reeborg has limited movement commands and must follow a predefined set of instructions.
The maze may contain walls, obstacles, or other hazards that Reeborg cannot pass through.
Reeborg's movement must be guided by the program without human intervention once started.
